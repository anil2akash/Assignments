10. What Is Bayes' Theorem?

    The Bayes’ theorem is a mathematical formula used to determine the conditional probability of events. 
    Essentially, the Bayes’ theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the-
    conditions that might be relevant to the event.

    The Bayes’ theorem is expressed in the following formula:

     	p(A|B)=(p(B|A)*p(A))/p(B)

	Where:

	P(A|B) – the probability of event A occurring, given event B has occurred
	P(B|A) – the probability of event B occurring, given event A has occurred
	P(A) – the probability of event A
	P(B) – the probability of event B

11. What is z-score?

     The z-score (standard score) gives us an idea of how far a data point is from the mean. 
     z-score is the number of standard deviations from the mean value of the reference population.

	The basic z score formula for a sample is:

		z = (x – µ) / s

12. What is t-test?

---> A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine the significant difference between the means of two groups, 
     which may be related in certain features.

---> A t-test is used as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption applicable to a population. 

---> A t-test looks at the t-statistic, the t-distribution values, and the degrees of freedom to determine the statistical significance. 
     To conduct a test with three or more means, one must use an analysis of variance.

13. What is a percentile?

---> In statistics, a percentile is a type of quantile which divides the given probability distribution, or sample, into 100 equal-sized intervals
     this allows the data to be analyzed in terms of percentages.
---> Percentiles are used to understand and interpret data. The nth percentile of a set of data is the value at which n percent of the data is below it. 

	Percentiles for the values in a given data set can be calculated using the formula:

	n = (P/100) x N

	where N = number of values in the data set, 
	      P = percentile, and 
	      n = ordinal rank of a given value in the data set sorted from smallest to largest.

14. What is ANOVA?

	ANOVA - Analysis of variance
---> It is an analysis tool used in statistics that splits an observed aggregate variability found inside a data set into two parts(systematic and random).
     The systematic factors have a statistical influence on the given data set, while the random factors do not. 
---> ANOVA test is used to determine the influence that independent variables have on the dependent variable in a regression study.

	The Formula for ANOVA is:

	F= MST/MSE

	where:

	F=ANOVA coefficient
	MST=Mean sum of squares due to treatment
	MSE=Mean sum of squares due to error	

15. How can ANOVA help?

---> The one-way ANOVA can help to know whether or not there are significant differences between the means of independent variables.
