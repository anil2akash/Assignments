Q10 to Q15 are subjective answer type questions, Answer them briefly.

10. Explain how does the adjusted R-squared penalize the presence of unnecessary predictors in the model?

	--> The adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.
	--> The adjusted R-squared increases only if the new term improves the model more than would be expected by chance. 
	--> It decreases when a predictor improves the model by less than expected by chance.

11. Differentiate between Ridge and Lasso Regression.

	--> Ridge is computationally less intensive than Lasso.
	--> Lasso tends to make coefficients to absolute zero as compared to Ridge which never sets the value of coefficient to absolute zero.

12. What is VIF? What is the suitable value of a VIF for a feature to be included in a regression modelling?

	VIF stands for Variance Inflation Factor 
	--> It quantifies the extent of correlation between one predictor and the other predictors in a model. 
            It is used for diagnosing collinearity/multicollinearity.Higher values signify that it is difficult to
            assess accurately the contribution of predictors to a model.

	--> The values of VIF around 1 for a feature can be included in a regression modelling

13. Why do we need to scale the data before feeding it to the train the model?

	--> It is a step of Data Pre Processing which is applied to independent variables or features of data. 
	--> It basically helps to normalise the data within a particular range. 
	--> Sometimes, it also helps in speeding up the calculations in an algorithm.

14. What are the different metrics which are used to check the goodness of fit in linear regression?

	--> Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
	--> R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
	--> The F-test are the different metrics which are used to check the goodness of fit in linear regression

15. From the following confusion matrix calculate sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall and accuracy.

Actual/Predicted	True 		False
True			1000		50
False			250		1200

Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN) = 1000/(1000+250) = 0.8

Specificity = TN/(FP+TN) = 1200/(50+1200) = 0.96

Precision   = TP/(TP+FP) = 1000/(1000+50) = 0.952

Recall      = TP/(TP+FN) = 1000/(1000+250) = 0.8

Accuracy    = (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN) = (1000+1200)/(1000+50+250+1200) = 0.88
