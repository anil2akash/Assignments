Q11 to Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

11. Write a python program to find the factorial of a number.

def factorial(n): 
    if n < 0: 
        return 0
    elif n == 0 or n == 1: 
        return 1
    else: 
        fact = 1
        while(n > 1): 
            fact *= n 
            n -= 1
        return fact

num = int(input("Enter any number : "))
print("Factorial of num is", factorial(num))
	
Output : 

	Enter any number : 5

	Factorial of 5 is 120


12. Write a python program to find whether a number is prime or composite.

num = int(input("Enter any number : "))
if num > 1:
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is NOT a PRIME number")
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a PRIME number")
elif num == 0 or 1:
    print(num, "is a neither PRIME NOR COMPOSITE number")
else:
    print(num, "is NOT a PRIME number it is a COMPOSITE number")

Output : 

	Enter any number : 5
	5 is a PRIME number


13. Write a python program to check whether a given string is palindrome or not.

string = input("Please enter your own String : ")

if(string == string[:: - 1]):
   print("This is a Palindrome String")
else:
   print("This is Not a Palindrome String")


Output : 

	Please enter your own String : hello
	This is Not a Palindrome String

	Please enter your own String : mom
	This is a Palindrome String


14. Write a Python program to get the third side of right-angled triangle from two given sides.

from math import sqrt

print('Assume the sides are a, b, c and c is the hypotenuse.')

choice = input('Which side (a, b, c) do you want to calculate? side: ')

if choice == 'c':

    a = float(input('Input the length of side a: '))
    b = float(input('Input the length of side b: '))

    c = sqrt(a * a + b * b)

    print('The length of side c is %g: ' %(c))

elif choice == 'b':
    a = float(input('Input the length of side a: '))
    c = float(input('Input the length of side c: '))

    b = sqrt(c * c - a * a)

    print('The length of side b is %g: ' %(b))

elif choice == 'a':
    b = float(input('Input the length of side b: '))
    c = float(input('Input the length of side c: '))

    a = sqrt((c * c) - (b * b))

    print('The length of side a is %g: ' %(a))

else:
    print('Invalid Input!')


Output : 

	Assume the sides are a, b, c and c is the hypotenuse.
	Which side (a, b, c) do you want to calculate? side: c
	Input the length of side a: 2
	Input the length of side b: 3
	The length of side c is 3.60555: 


15. Write a python program to print the frequency of each of the characters present in a given string.

from collections import Counter 

print('Enter The String:')
x = input() 

res = Counter(x) 

print ("Count of all characters x is :\n " + str(res))


Output : 

	Enter The String:
	anil kumar
	Count of all characters in x is :
	 Counter({'a': 2, 'n': 1, 'i': 1, 'l': 1, ' ': 1, 'k': 1, 'u': 1, 'm': 1, 'r': 1})
