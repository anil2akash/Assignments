Q11 to Q13 are subjective questions, answer them briefly

11. Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary.

   --> A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements
   --> A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. 
	In someways a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects and repetition but a tuple is immutable unlike lists which are mutable.
   --> A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements.
   --> Dictionaries are Python's implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. 
	A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

12. Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’
    with space in python.

   --> Python strings are immutable,

   import re
   text = 'I+Love+Python'
   text =text.replace ("+", " ")
   print(text)

   Output : 
 
   I Love Python

13. What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting the datatype of a variable in python.

	--> Ord() - It stands for ordinal, The ord() function in Python accepts a string  as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. 
		For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character 'B'.

	Syntax for getting datatype of variable in python is,

	Type(Variable_Name)

	Example :
	
	a = 12
	print(type(a))
	
	O/P :
	<class 'int'>


Q14 and Q15 are programming questions. Answer them in Jupyter Notebook.

14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form ????2 + ???? + ?? = 0. 
    Where a, b and c are to be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.

#complex math module
import cmath

# Taking input
a = float(input('Enter a: '))
b = float(input('Enter b: '))
c = float(input('Enter c: '))

# calculate the discriminant
d = (b**2) - (4*a*c)

# find two solutions
sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))

O/P :
 
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 5
Enter c: 6
The solution are (-3+0j) and (-2+0j)


15. Write a python program to find the sum of first ‘n’ natural numbers without using any loop. 
    Ask user to input the value of ‘n’.

n = float(input('Enter n: '))
sum = n * (n+1) / 2
print("Sum of the first ", n, "natural numbers using formula is: ", sum )

O/P :

Enter n: 20
Sum of the first  20.0 natural numbers using formula is:  210.0
